# hydroPSO
hydroPSO is a global optimisation R package implementing a state-of-the-art version of the Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm (SPSO-2011 and SPSO-2007 capable), with a special focus on the calibration of environmental models. 

hydroPSO is parallel-capable, to alleviate the computational burden of complex models.

hydroPSO is model-independent, allowing the user to easily interface any model code with the calibration engine (PSO), and includes a series of controlling options and PSO variants to fine-tune the performance of the optimisation engine. An advanced sensitivity analysis function together with user-friendly plotting summaries facilitate the interpretation and assessment of the calibration results. 


Bugs / comments / questions / collaboration of any kind are very welcomed.
